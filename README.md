# Objective

This project is a learning project on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. 

The goal is to use a Neural Network for the embedding layer on processed text data, before fitting a classfication model to classify tweets into four categories: `Positive`, `Negative`, `Neutral`, `Irrelevant`.

While there may be faster or more effective methods to classify our data, the objective is to learn NLP and Deep Learning through application.
